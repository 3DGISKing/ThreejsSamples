Hello, I recently received 3D model from designer, which is in .glTF format (exported from Blender with Khronos exporter).
There is also a .bin assets file coming with this .glTF file.
The problem is - when I upload this model in my code it looks quite different from what I see in Online glTF viewer, see: https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/
Also with model comes only one 8s animation which is accessible via glft.animations[0]

I cant get it work, although in online viewer it seems to be working fine.

I'm attaching an error that I get.

The third thing - I need to make this model rotating around self (x/y rotation). But when I try to call gltf.scene.rotation/x/y - it not only rotates but also moves around Orbit, I do not need that movement, just rotation in place.

So three things:

1) Making 3D model in Three.JS code as much similar as in 3D viewer.

2) Trying to get animation working.

3) Rotation solution.

ATTENTION! I'm attaching model - when using with online viewer - please drag ENTIRE folder, not separate files.
