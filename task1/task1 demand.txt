Objectives:
Start developing perspective view, lighting and shading in WebGL Applications
Try to interact the lighting and objects in the web app
Learning camera view, lighting, transformations of WebGL implementation

Things to do:
Create a bigger canvas to allow users to create cubes and spheres from HTML UIs.
Use perspective view.
Create a white point light to the environment.
By default, the environment should have two spheres, one is using vertex lighting shadier, the other is using fragment lighting shadier.
For the new cubes and spheres, you can choose use only one lighting shadier.
Allow the users to determine where the new cube or sphere will be before creating
Any created cubes or spheres need to be randomly assigned a rotation direction x or y or z, which means they are rotating along one axis after showing on the screen.
Allow users to create cones too.
Allow users to move the light source around.
Allow users to manipulate the two-default sphere (translate, rotate and scale in 3D)
Allow users to change the color of the light.
